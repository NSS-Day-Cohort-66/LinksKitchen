## Link’s Kitchen

Link has a bunch of ingredients and he want’s to experiment and see what kinds of meals he can make with them. He knows for sure that when he cooks `Hylian Rice` with a `Big Hearty Truffle` that he gets `Mushroom Rice Balls`, but for some reason he’s not seeing it in his meals…

On his travels, he found some recipes on the walls of the stables he’s visited:

- `Hateno Cheese` and a `Bird Egg` will make a `Cheesy Omlette`
- `Tabantha Wheat` and `Hateno Cheese` will make a `Cheesy Hylian Pizza`
- `Raw Prime Meat` and `Hylian Rice` will make `Prime Meat and Rice Bowl`
